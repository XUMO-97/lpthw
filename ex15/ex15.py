# study drills 4:Get rid of the part from lines 10- 15 where you use raw_input and try the script then.
# just print the txt once

# study drills 5:Use only raw_input and try the script that way. Think of why one way of getting the filename would be better than another.

# if don't use raw_input I needn't to print the filename in python just in command line.

# study drills 7:Start python again and use open from the prompt. Notice how you can open fi les and run read on them right there? 
# read=open("C:/Users/18402/lpthw/ex15/ex15_sample.txt")

# read.close()

# study drills 8:Have your script also do a close() on the txt and txt_again variables. Itâ€™s important to close fi les when you are done with them.
