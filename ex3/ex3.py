# study drills 1:Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.

# just print some words
print "I will now count my chickens:" 

# print the word "Hens" then print the calculation after it
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6 
# print the word "Roosters" then print the calculation after it
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4 

# print the sentence
print "Now I will count the eggs:" 

# print the calculation
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6 

# print the sentence
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?" 

# print the calculation
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

# print sentence and calculation
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
# the same as above
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

# print sentence
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

# sentence
print "How about some more."

# sentence and calculation and the following is same
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2

# study drills 3:Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py fi le that does it.

# 1 / 3 = 0 In order to cooperate with the author I feel very suprised although I know the reason

# study drills 4:Notice the math seems “wrong”? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. Find out why by researching what a “fl oating point” number is.

# 1 / 3 has floating point so I should use floating-point calculation then can get the number after decimal point

# study drills 5:Rewrite ex3.py to use fl oating point numbers so it’s more accurate (hint: 20.0 is fl oating point).
