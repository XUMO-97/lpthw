# study drills 1ï¼šGo through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.
# the above

# study drills 2:Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
# 1.y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary, do_not)   There is two.
# 2. print "I said: %r." % x
# 3.print "I also said: '%s'." % y

# study drills 3:Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.
# There is two in y, then print "I also said: '%s'." % y transfer y so there is also two string in the string.

# study drills 4:Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.
# Use + is a kind of way to stitch strings.
